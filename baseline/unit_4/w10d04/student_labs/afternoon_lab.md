# Stock Price Database - Continued

Now your boss wants the price index and show routes to return the stock's
company name and ticker symbol instead of the stock_id. Modify this morning's lab to satisfy your boss's outrageous demand and get that big end of year bonus!

If you're feeling ambitious add some routes to get prices for a range of dates. The new routes should include the stock information, not the stock_id.
