# AngularJS - Includes

## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe why we need includes
1. Include an external file
1. Include a template already in the HTML
1. Dynamically change includes

## Describe why we need includes

Includes allow us to take reusable content and move it into external files so that we don't copy and paste the same code over and over

In terms of your group project, by separating code into different files, it will be easier to split up the work for AngularJS.

## Include an external file

Use the following syntax to include an external html file. **Note the extra single quotes since it can take valid javascript**

```html
<div ng-include="'partials/included.html'"></div>
```

Inside this external file, you can do write normal html with angular directives.  You can even reference controllers outside of the file that are ancestors.

It does this via AJAX, but normally a browser cannot make an AJAX request to a file on a computer (insecure!).  Two ways around this:

- Start a basic http server from the command line
- Start up chrome with extra params
	- `open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files`

Let's run an http-server

## Running Angular Server with http-server

We're going to create a basic AngularJS application, without an Express server for this exercise. We want to be able to browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). We are *not* using `nodemon` for this exercise, nor do we need `mongod`.

- Install `npm-server` by running `npm install -g http-server` from the terminal.
- if you get an error about needed to be root/admin try typing `sudo !!` - that should rerun the previous command with sudo, be sure to enter your computer's password or try `sudo npm install -g http-server`
- `cd` into `includes/starter-code` folder and
- Run the server with `http-server -o`
- View the `index.html` by browsing to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


## Navigation Bar

file: **partials/navigation.html**

```html
<h5>Home</h5>
<h5>About</h5>
<h5>Contact</h5>
<h5>Locations</h5>
```

**file: index.html**

```html
<body ng-controller='BaseCtrl as ctrl'>
  <nav ng-include="'partials/navigation.html'"></nav>
	...
</body>
```
**REMEMBER:** the single quotes inside the double quotes around the name

Our nav bar should now appear


## Move our Menu into is Own Partial

- `touch partials/menu.html`
-  cut and paste:

```html
<div class="menu">
  <h3>Menu</h3>
  <hr>
      <dl ng-repeat="water in ctrl.waters">
        <dt>{{water.brand}}</dt>
        <dd>${{water.price}}</dd>
      </dl>
</div>
```

into `partials/menu.html`

write in a new includes, to include the new partial

```html
<div class="container">
  <div ng-include="'partials/menu'">
</div>

```

## Dynamically change includes

Since our include can be javascript, we can set it to controller variables

file: index.html
```html
		<div ng-include="ctrl.includePath"></div>
```

When we change those variables like normal, the partial will update too

file: js/app.js

```javascript
  this.includePath = 'partials/menu.html';
  this.changeInclude = (path) => {
  this.includePath = 'partials/'+ path +'.html';
  }
```

file: partials/navigation.html
```html
<h5 ng-click="ctrl.changeInclude('menu')">Home</h5>
<h5 ng-click="ctrl.changeInclude('about')">About</h5>
<h5 ng-click="ctrl.changeInclude('contact')">Contact</h5>
<h5 ng-click="ctrl.changeInclude('location')">Locations</h5>
```


## Full code

app.js
```js
const app = angular.module('WaterApp', []);

app.controller('BaseCtrl', [function(){

  this.includePath = 'partials/menu.html';
  this.changeInclude = (path) => {
  this.includePath = 'partials/'+ path +'.html';
}

this.waters = [
  {
  "countryOfOrigin": "USA",
  "price": 4,
  "brand": "Tap"
},
{
  "brand": "Dasani",
  "countryOfOrigin": "USA",
  "price": 5
},
{
  "brand": "Schwepps",
  "countryOfOrigin": "USA",
  "price": 8
