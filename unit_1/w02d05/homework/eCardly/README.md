## Objectives
* More reps building webpage from an image

## Activity
* Inside the [starter folder provided](eCardly), you'll find the [mockup image](eCardly/screenshot-final.png) that you should recreate
* Inside that starter folder as well is [another folder](eCardly/images) with all the images you'll need for the recreation
* Below are a few steps to help you get started

### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the background.jpg provided for you in the images folder. The image should repeat only going left and right. The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6.
    - Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line.

* The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

* Define a line height for the body of 1.7.  This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.

### Header Picture

* The `<h1>` tag with the `<a>` tag inside of it should not be text but an image.

* Please remove the text from the html.

* Set the background of the `<a>` tag within an `<h1>` to the logo.png.

* Size it's height and width appropriately to fit the full logo.

* Have it display block.  This will have this tag appear on it's on line.  (It is how we can make it appear here).

* Center it.
