- Make an app that uses a search form to show the weather in any city the user searches for. Use the [Open Weather map](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get a forecast and display it on the page.
- If the user searches for another city, make sure the page is only showing ONE city's forecast at a time (i.e. make sure the previous results don't stay on the page)
- As a bonus mode, allow a drop-down menu for the user tochoose how many days' worth of forecasts they want, then display that many days of weather predictions on the page.
