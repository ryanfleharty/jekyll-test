## Fake Resume Page 

![](https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/547604f80c6f622e76db7563/16:9/pass/grumpy-tout.jpg)

Grumpy cat is looking for a new job! Using what you know about HTML and CSS, help him by creating a resume website for him. (Note: You don't need to know 'real information' about Grumpy Cat -- just make things up!) 

This is what he wants you to include and do for his resume: 

- have an `index.html` file
- have an `main.css` file that is linked to the `index.html` file
- have HTML `boilerplate` code for `index.html` 
  - _HINT:_ in your `index.html` file type `html` and press tab. A few basic HTML tags should populate your file, including `head` and `body`
- Include:
  - at least one header
  - navigation (these can be dummy links that don't go anywhere yet)
  - at least one list
  - change the font color in at least one place
  - change the background in at least one place
  - change the font in at least one place

## Fake Resume Page - Getting Started 

1. Inside your `homework` folder for today, create a new folder called `resume_page`.
1. Change directories to `resume_page`.
1. From inside this file, create two files: `index.html` and `style.css`.
1. Using Visual Studio Code, open your files and add the HTML boilerplate code.
1. Create a heading level-one tag with the name: Grumpy Cat.
1. Open the `index.html` in your browser to confirm that everything is set up properly.

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"resume index.html file is setup"

## Fake Resume Page - Adding Content 

1. Insert a professional image of Grumpy Cat ('img' tag), it should be placed right after your 'h1' tags
1. Insert an unordered list of his past three work positions ('ul' tag)
1. Create links for LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages ('a' tag). You can set this to a dummy link
1. Use level-three heading tags to create headings before the work positions and before the links

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added initial content for resume site"

## Fake Resume Page - Adding Style 

Add some style to your site and feel free to style it however you want! Here are some ideas:

1. Center your "h1" tag
1. Change the font of your "h1" tag
1. Change the color of the font of your "h3" tag
1. Add some space on the body of your application to make your site look more appealing.

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added styling for resume site"

## Fake Resume Page - Adding Navigation 

1. Create a nav bar with the links to LinkedIn, Twitter (whichever links you had created earlier); Remove the links section that you had created earlier in the homework
1. In the nav bar, also create a link to the 'index.html' page (maybe give it a name of `Home Page` in the bar), and a link to a file called "projects.html" (maybe call this `Projects` in the bar)
1. Create another html file in this folder called 'projects.html'
1. Copy the contents of the nav bar and information from the 'head' tag of your `index.html` file and paste it into your `projects.html` file<
1. Inside `projects.html`, create a level-two heading and add the text `Projects`
1. Check to make sure that your links work! When you click on "Projects" in your nav bar, does it open the `projects.html` document?
1. In `projects.html`, add three projects that Grumpy Cat has worked on. To do this simply, you can use an ordered list. If you're up for a little more of a challenge, create three columns: each column should contain the title and a description of their three most recent, successful projects

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added project.html page and content - finished resume"
