Now, let's get in a little bit of JavaScript practice.  Specifically, more loops! Create a `loops.js` file and complete the following section in that file.

Pick **five** to tackle.

1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 0-99 (ascending)
1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 99-0 (descending)
1. Create a loop that logs the **EVEN** numbers from 0-98 (ascending)
1. Create a loop that logs the **EVEN** numbers from 98-0 (descending)
1. Create a loop that logs the **ODD** numbers from 0-99 (ascending)
1. Create a loop that logs the **ODD** numbers from 99-0 (descending)
1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 49-72 (ascending)
1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 81-26 (descending)
1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 3-90 **that are multiples of 3** (ascending)
