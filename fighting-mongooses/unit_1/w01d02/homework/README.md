1. Commit your work at each point when directed (remember to `git add .` and then `git commit -m "your commit message here"`).

## Git & Github - Questions 

Refer back to the notes from today and/or use the internet and google-fu to find the answers to the questions below: 

**Answer the following questions**

1. What command do you use to setup a git repository inside of your folder?
1. What command do you use to ask git to start tracking a file?

# Section 2: Terminal Practice

## Episode X: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a Unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who
knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to
enter… The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in
Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

## Setup

* Open the **Terminal app**

* Make a directory in the folder created by this clone called `galaxy_far_far_away`.  

* Create a file called `commands.txt`.

* Paste the answer to each numbered question (i.e. the command(s) that accomplished the task) in `commands.txt` once you get it to work.

* Remember, you can learn about any Unix command by typing `man` and then the command name.  E.g., `man ls`.  Type `Q` to get out of the Manual page ("man page") viewer.


## Part I: Set the Scene

Complete all work inside the `galaxy_far_far_away` folder.

1. Create a directory called `death_star`, and make the following files inside of it: `darth_vader.txt`, `princess_leia.txt`, `storm_trooper.txt`

2. In `galaxy_far_far_away`, make a directory named `tatooine` and create the following files in it: `luke.txt`, `ben_kenobi.txt`.

3. Inside of `tatooine` make a directory called `millenium_falcon`, and in it create: `han_solo.txt`, `chewbaca.txt`

<br>

## Part II: `mv` - rename

* You can rename a file using the `mv` command. 

4. Rename `ben_kenobi.txt` to `obi_wan.txt`.

<br>

## Part II: `cp` - copy

* You can copy a file from one location to another using the `cp` command. (`man cp` for more info)

- Directories can be sibling (parrell to each other) or can be parents (the folder that contains the folder you are in)

5. Copy `storm_trooper.txt` from `death_star` to `tatooine`.

<br>

## Part IV: `mv` - move

* You can use the `mv` command to move files from one location to another. `mv` can be used for renaming, moving, or both.  Run `man mv` to see the options—remember hit the `Q` key to get out of the manual page viewer.

6. Move `luke.txt` and `obi_wan.txt` to the `millenium_falcon`.

7. Move `millenium_falcon` out of `tatooine` and into `galaxy_far_far_away`.

8. Move `millenium_falcon` into `death_star`.

9. Move `princess_leia.txt` into the `millenium_falcon`.

<br>


## Part V: `rm` - remove

### ***BE CAREFUL WITH `rm`!!! THERE IS NO "TRASH" IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER!!!***

You can use `rm` to delete a file.


10. Delete `obi_wan.txt`.

<br>

## Part VI: all together

11. In `galaxy_far_far_away`, make a directory called `yavin_4`.

12. Move the `millenium_falcon` out of the `death_star` and into `yavin_4`.

13. Make a directory in `yavin_4` called `x_wing`.

14. Move `princess_leia.txt` to `yavin_4` and `luke.txt` to `x_wing`.

15. Move the `millenium_falcon` and `x_wing` out of `yavin_4` and into `galaxy_far_far_away`.

16. In `death_star`, create directories for `tie_fighter_1`, `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`.

17. Move `darth_vader.txt` into `tie_fighter_1`.

18. Make a copy of `storm_trooper.txt` in both `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`.

19. Move all of the `tie_fighters` out of the `death_star` and into `galaxy_far_far_away`.

<br>

## Part VII: `rm -r`: remove directories and everything they contain

***BE CAREFUL WITH `rm`!!! THERE IS NO TRASH CAN IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER***

Before you hit enter, make sure are deleting the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).

This command will not typically ask you if you "really want to delete." It will just delete.


20. Remove `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`.


## Part VIII:

21. Touch a file in `x_wing` called `the_force.txt`.

22. Destroy the `death_star` and anyone inside of it.

23. Return `x_wing` and the `millenium_falcon` to `yavin_4`.
