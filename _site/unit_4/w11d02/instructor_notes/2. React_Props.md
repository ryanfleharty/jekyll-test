# Intro to React Props

## Learning Objectives
 - Learn about props
 - Learn how to pass props
 - Learn difference between props and state


## Props
  Props is short for properties. We know that a component can have state (a view based on data). If we think back to our React Store, we had just one component. It was a pretty small app, so one component was fine. But as we would continue to build out functionality, our one component would get very complex and the code could expand to hundreds or thousands of lines. Maintaining such a large component would be really hard.

  We'd likely start out by wanting a component for our items. Let's continue to build our app.

## Continue with Create React App and our New SongList Component

Let's **MOVE** our song list to our new component

From **App.js**
```js
<div className="playlist">
  <h3>{this.state.playlists.title}</h3>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Song</th>
        <th>Artist</th>
        <th>Time</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    {  this.state.playlists.songs.map((song, index )=> {
        return (
          <tr key={index}>
            <td>{song.title}</td>
            <td>{song.artist}</td>
            <td>{song.time}</td>
          </tr>
        )
      })}
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```
To **src/components/SongList**

```js
class SongList extends Component {
  render () {
    return (<h3> All the products</h3>)
  }
}
```

Change to our data:

```js
class SongList extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div className="playlist">
        <h3>{this.props.playlists.title}</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Song</th>
              <th>Artist</th>
              <th>Time</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          {  this.props.playlists.songs.map((song, index )=> {
              return (
                <tr key={index}>
                  <td>{song.title}</td>
                  <td>{song.artist}</td>
                  <td>{song.time}</td>
                </tr>
              )
            })}
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

**App component**

```js

<div className="playlists">
  <SongList />
</div>

```

When we load this we get `product is not defined`. This is because our new component doesn't have access to the state of the parent component. We can pass down state to our component with props.


**App component**

```js

<div className="playlists">
  <SongList playlists={this.state.playlists}/>
</div>

```

Now we can access the data we're passing down in the property `product` to `this.props` in our `SongList` component

**SongList Component**


## A Component that Has Props and State

First let's practice making a new component

- `touch src/components/Song.js`


```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Song extends Component {
  render () {
    return
  }
}
export default Song;
```

Import this component into the `SongList`

```
import Song from './Song.js'
```

Let's move our `tr`s into this component

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Song extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <tr key={index}>
        <td>{song.title}</td>
        <td>{song.artist}</td>
        <td>{song.time}</td>
      </tr>
    )
  }
}
export default Song;
```

Update our **SongList.js**

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Song from './Song.js'

class SongList extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <ul>
      { this.props.playlists.songs.map((song, index) => {
        return (
          <Song song={song} key={index}/>
        )
      })}
      </ul>
    )
  }
}
export default SongList;
```

Update our Song component

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Song extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <tr key={this.props.index}>
        <td>{this.props.song.title}</td>
        <td>{this.props.song.artist}</td>
        <td>{this.props.song.time}</td>
      </tr>
    )
  }
}
export default Song;
```

 Let's say we want a user to be able to love a song  by clicking on a song. If the song is liked, a heart will appear.

 Remember, if we want a component to have state we must add the constructor function


 ```js
 class Song extends React.Component {
   constructor () {
     this.state = {
       love: false
     }
   }
   render () {
     return (
       <tr key={this.props.index}>
         <td>{this.props.song.title}</td>
         <td>{this.props.song.artist}</td>
         <td>{this.props.song.time}</td>
       </tr>
     )
   }
 }
 ```

When we run this, we get an error:

 ```
 'this' is not allowed before super()
 ```
 We have to add `super` in. `super` is a keyword that allows us to inherit from the parent class and add add new properties. Look back on the documentation of `classes` for more information. For now, we just have to add some code to our constructor

 ```js
 constructor (props) {
   super(props)
   this.state = {
     inShoppingCart: false
   }
 }
 ```

 Now we can conditionally render a heart whether or not an song is loved


```js
return (
  <tr key={this.props.index}
  onClick={this.toggleLove}>
    <td>{this.props.song.title}</td>
    <td>{this.props.song.artist}</td>
    <td>{this.props.song.time}</td>
    {this.state.love ? <td>&hearts;</td> : <td></td>}
  </tr>
)
```

Let's add a function to allow us to toggle the value

```js
toggleLove() {
  this.setState({love : !this.state.love})
}
```

And remember, we must bind `this` in the constructor

```js
constructor (props) {
  super(props)
  this.state = {
    inShoppingCart: false
  }
  this.love = this.love.bind(this)
}
```


Finally, let's add an `onClick` that will allow us to toggle the value of `love` for each song - let's put it on the whole row so our user can click anywhere on the row

```js
<tr key={this.props.index}
onClick={this.toggleLove}>
```

Now, we should be able to click on the item and toggle whether or not we see the message that the item is in the shopping cart.

## Extra Challenges

- double click the song name to delete it from the list
- add functionality that lets you click on an icon (arrow?) of two songs and then swaps their order
- Allow for multiple playlists to be rendered, when adding a new song, let a user select a playlist to add to or to create a new playlist
- Add some sweet sweet css style!
