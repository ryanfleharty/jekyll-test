<ul>
  <li>This is a two Player game (one human and one computer)</li>
  <li>Each Player has a Barracks (see below)</li>
  <li>Each Player starts with 10 hit points</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="barracks">Barracks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A Barracks can generate a Peon (see below)</li>
  <li>A Barracks keeps a list of its generated peons</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="peon">Peon</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A Peon has a name</li>
  <li>A Peon has a job, one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>nothing (this is the initial value upon creating a peon)</li>
      <li>repair</li>
      <li>attack</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="flow-of-game">Flow of game:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>At the start of player’s turn, ask what the user wants to do (one of the following)
    <ul>
      <li>Create a peon
        <ol>
          <li>If chosen, ask what the peon’s name should be</li>
          <li>Have the player’s barracks generate a peon with the correct name</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Select a peon
        <ol>
          <li>If chosen, ask which peon they want to select</li>
          <li>Once a peon is chosen, ask what action the peon should perform
            <ul>
              <li>attack
                <ul>
                  <li>If chosen, set the peon’s job to attack</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>repair
                <ul>
                  <li>If chosen, set the peon’s job to repair</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once this is complete, loop through the peons in the player’s barracks
    <ul>
      <li>If a peon’s job is to repair, increase the user’s hit points by one</li>
      <li>If a peon’s job is to attack, decrease the computer’s hit points by one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once this is complete, start the computer’s turn
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a random number from 0-2</li>
      <li>0: computer does nothing</li>
      <li>1: computer repairs itself
        <ul>
          <li>increase computer hit points by one</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2: computer attacks player
        <ul>
          <li>decrease player hit points by one</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evaluate the state of the game:
    <ul>
      <li>If the computer has 0 or fewer hit points, you win</li>
      <li>If you have 0 or fewer hit points, the computer wins</li>
      <li>If you both have 0 or fewer hit points, it’s a tie</li>
      <li>If you both have more than 0 hit points, start player’s turn over again (step 1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hungry-for-more">Hungry for more?</h2>

<h3 id="make-it-in-the-dom">Make it in the DOM</h3>
<ul>
  <li>if you’ve written your game well and it fully functions in the console, you should be able to make new functions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">message</code> that will print a message in the DOM, rather than making an alert</li>
  <li>And be able to swap <code class="highlighter-rouge">prompts</code> for either an input box, or specific buttons for your user to use.</li>
  <li>So you still be passing in the same text, and getting the same response from your prompts, but it’ll render in the DOM.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Make it so that the computer doesn’t randomly attack/repair/do nothing itself.  Instead, it will act like a player and either create a peon or, if a peon already exists, select a random peon and tell it to either attack or repair</li>
  <li>Make the 2nd player optionally be either the computer (random decisions) or another human</li>
  <li>Repairs increase hit points a random number between 0-3</li>
  <li>Attacks decrease hit points a random number between 0-3</li>
</ol>
