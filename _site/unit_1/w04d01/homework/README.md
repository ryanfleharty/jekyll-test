## Deliverables

1. Complete MVP for the [ajax lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Web-Development-Immersive-Remote/WDIR-Stan-Lee/blob/master/unit_1/w04d01/student_labs/ajax-lab.md) you worked on during lab today. 
1. Research and find an API you're interested in using for your first project, and come up with an app idea that you'd like to create for project 1. 
    - Include also: wireframes for mobile and desktop views of your app 
      - Note: This can be a rough sketch of just the general idea you have in mind. If you change your mind later on as you actually start to code your app, no worries! The final product design doesn't have to match your initial wireframe, we just want you to start thinking about it early!

## Technical Requirements
1. The ajax lab portion of the homework MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong. 

## Submission Guidelines

- The ajax lab portion of the homework should be submitted via an issue as always before 10AM tomorrow. 
- Your project idea/wireframe and API choice will be due whenever you meet with your instructor for project approvals sometime tomorrow.
