## Define what React Is

React is a front-end framework which is designed to make building a Single Page JavaScript Application easier

## Describe how react differs from most other front-end frameworks

- Most other front-end frameworks attempt to separate data from presentation in some kind of an MVC structure
    - For example
        - One set files for HTML (View)
        - One set of files for your Controllers
        - One set of files for your Models (data)
    - Great for teams where developers specialize on one technology (CSS or JavaScript)
- React puts all the Views, Controllers, and Models for one small section of the application together into one file
    - Great for teams where one developer handles just a small section of the application and that's it

## Create a basic component

### HTML

Let's set up the HTML

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.3.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
        <script type="text/babel" src="js/app.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <main></main>
    </body>
</html>
```

Let's talk about all those script tags

- react.js
    - The core React functionality
    - React can be used for applications that aren't in the browser
        - so it's separated out from code that deals with the browser
- react-dom.js
    - This allows the core React js to work with the browser's DOM
- browser.min.js (babel-core)
    - Babel is a transpiler that will translate ES6 code to ES5
    - it also handles turning JSX into regular JS

### JS

- Let's create a component which is just an H1 tag
- We'll insert it into the `main` tag of our html

```JavaScript
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1 className="foo">Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.querySelector('main')
);
```

- This code will find the main tag and render an `h1` tag inside of it
    - **NOTE** we can't set class with the `class` attribute anymore
        - We have to use className so it doesn't get confused
        - All other attributes should work normally
- React mixes HTML with JavaScript (JSX)
    - Notice that the HTML does not have quotes or backticks around it

use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to start a basic server for our code.  If you're using python version 3.x, use `python -m http.server`

## Assign JSX to a variable

JSX just renders into regular JavaScript, so we can assign it to variable:

```JavaScript
const myJSX = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

ReactDOM.render(
  myJSX,
  document.querySelector('main')
);
```

## Embed an expression into JSX

We can create variables and insert them into our JSX:

```JavaScript
const user = "Matt";
const myJSX = <h1>Hello, {user}!</h1>

ReactDOM.render(
  myJSX,
  document.querySelector('main')
);
```

We can even execute functions inside the `{}`

```JavaScript
const formatUser = (user)=>{
    return user + "!!"
}
const user = "Matt";
const myJSX = <h1>Hello, {formatUser(user)}</h1>

ReactDOM.render(
  myJSX,
  document.querySelector('main')
);
```

## Create multi-line JSX variables

JSX can be split onto multiple lines:

```JavaScript
const formatUser = (user)=>{
    return user + "!!"
}
const user = "Matt";
const myJSX =
    <section>
        <h1>Hello, {formatUser(user)}</h1>
        Welcome to the app
    </section>

ReactDOM.render(
  myJSX,
  document.querySelector('main')
);
```
